# RealRuins

Done recently:
 * Add support for SRTS ships

ToDo:
 * Update offline blueprints database
 * Optimize current storage: now it have 3M+ blueprints, and I want to remove the oldest.
 * Move planetary ruins setup to the new game menu, so you can see ruins while picking a starting point
 * Change ideology-related mood modifiers behavior for ruin maps
 * Try to fix infamous SSL error issue (still not sure I can do it from my code)
 * Make optional ruins-based replacements for vanilla settlements (very controversial feature on my opinion, but it's requested really often. So I consider implementing it, but making off by default)
 * Try to do something with prices problem. This is a really complex issue, and I'll make a separate post about it later.
 * Rework pawn corpses saving/loading routine. Now it works one out of ten times because if pawn has even a scratch made from a weapon from a missing mod, the whole pawn is ignored. I'd like to try to ignore only incompatible item/body part/condition.
 * Rework events via new (haha two years old) quest system.
 * Add optional blacklist for items.
 * Add exportable settings presets.
